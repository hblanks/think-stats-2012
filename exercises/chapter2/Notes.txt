Don't quite understand the type of the "Items" method. Is it a dict? Had trouble iterating over it.

for k, v in pmf.Items(): # this worked

dist = pmf.Items
for k, v in dist.iteritems(): 
# this didn't work: 'function' object has no attribute 'iteritems'

dist = pmf.d.Items
for k, v in dist.iteritems():
	sum_probabilities += k*v
	return sum_probabilities
# this worked 'dict' object has no attribute 'Items'	

for k, v in pmf.Items: 
# This didn't work: 'instancemethod' object is not iterable

What's the difference between print on a dict vs print dict.d?

How do you print a pmf? pmf.d?

* How are people organizing their assignments and modules?

* For Pumpkins. Print things out with printf

* Things I don't really understand:
* iteritems()
